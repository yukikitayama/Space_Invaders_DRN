# Reinforcement Learning to OpenAI Gym Space Invaders

This is on-going personal project which implements reinforcement learning to Space Invaders.

## Environment
State space is images of height 210 by width 160 with 3 color channel, and action space is 6 discrete values of doing nothing, going right, going left, fire, going right and fire, and going left and fire. In an evaluation environment, the agent has 3 life values to survive. The higher scores you have, the better.

## Methodology
* Deep Q Network
* Double Deep Q Network
